Hello! I am a postgraduate student in the *Computational Applied Mathematics* programme at the University of Edinburgh, having also completed an undergraduate mathematics degree here between 2021 and 2025.

**Interests (Maths).** My favourite areas of mathematics typically fall in the realm of real analysis, complex analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis. Recently I have been particularly interested in how theory from complex analysis can be used in the design of numerical algorithms.

**Tutoring.** I have been privately tutoring mathematics since 2019, mostly online through Zoom, but occasionally in person too. Over the years I've created lots of teaching resources, many of which [are shared here](/pages/tutoring/). If you are looking for a tutor please [contact me](/contact/).

**Sport.** I was president of the [Edinburgh University table tennis club](https://www.eusu.ed.ac.uk/organisation/tabletennis/) between 2023-24 and 2024-25, and have been involved with the club and the [Edinburgh & Lothian table tennis league (ELTTL)](https://elttl.interactive.co.uk/) since starting University. In 2024 I was invited to be part of the Sport Union's finance committee, and in 2025 was [awarded colours](https://www.eusu.ed.ac.uk/awards/pastawardwinners/colours/) for my roles in Edinburgh sport.
