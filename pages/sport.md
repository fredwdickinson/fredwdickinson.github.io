### Edinburgh University Table Tennis Club

**Intramural table tennis** was a major focus of mine when on committee. It's first season was in 2023-24, more officially starting in 2024-25. [This is my most recent handbook](/assets/files/sport/EUTTC-IMS-Handbook.pdf) with corresponding [word document](/assets/files/sport/EUTTC-IMS-Handbook.docx) which work well as a starting point.


### General UoE Sport
**Racketlon** is a sport comprised of tennis, table tennis, badminton, and squash. Each year a few committee members from each sport come together to host a racketlon charity event.

I've helped run the event in 2024, 2025, and 2026. [Here is one template](/assets/files/sport/racketlon_blank.xlsx) that can be used on the day. Additionally, [this repository](https://github.com/fredwdickinson/racketlon-team-creater/tree/main) has small pieces of Python code that can generate racketlon teams with skill and gender balancing.
