My undergraduate mathematics experience was wonderfully varied, with courses in my master's far more streamlined. Here is a collection of some of my favourite pieces of work across a range of topics.

**1. The Basel problem** concerns the evaluation of the infinite sum of squared reciprocals
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$, or in terms of the zeta function, $\zeta(2)$. It's an interesting problem because its result, $\pi^2/6$, is surprisingly tidy, but also because there are so many interesting and vastly different proofs. My notes on the problem [can be found here.](/assets/files/maths/bsc/the_basel_problem.pdf)

**2. An interesting probability exercise** that defies intuition and motivates careful use of infinte sums. [See this repository.](https://github.com/fredwdickinson/probability-exercise)

**3. The importance of visualisation in learning mathematics** is important to me. [Here is a short essay](/assets/files/maths/bsc/visualisation-in_learning_mathematics.pdf) on the topic written for the Mathematical Education course in year four.

**4. Using complex variables for numerical algorithms** has been a recent interest of mine. One [seminar by Professor Bengt Fornberg](https://www.newton.ac.uk/seminar/40010/) (University of Colorado Boulder) inspired me [to create this poster](https://github.com/fredwdickinson/rscam-poster/) presented to peers and faculty members as part of the MSc research skills course.

**5. Meta-mathematical problems concerning the creation of 'nice cubics'** were part of my fourth year project. [This repository](https://github.com/fredwdickinson/creating-nice-cubics) explores what 'nice cubics' can be, along with some number theory and code examples for how to generate them.
